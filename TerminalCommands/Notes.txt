Be sure you are able to do the following operations through your terminal by the time you are done.

Open Terminal  
Navigate to your Desktop  
Create a new directory, call it 'test'  
Make files called index.html, styles.css, commands.txt inside the test directory  
Make a copy of index.html and call it index_2.html  
In the 'test' directory, remove the 'styles.css' file  
Navigate back to your desktop and make another directory, call it 'destination'  
Move the index_2.html file from 'test' to the 'destination' directory  
Now, check and see what files are in the 'test' and 'destination' directories  
Delete the 'destination' directory  Write the commands you used to do the above and save them in commands.txt. 
Then upload it below!  Spend 10 minutes researching some other terminal commands and keep them in mind for the future!
